            Professional freelance writer with a degree in Journalism and
            Communication from Paris 3 - Sorbonne Nouvelle University, Iâ€™ve been
            in this field for over 10 years.{' '}

            Although I first began as a PR, I rapidly switched to writing and
            copywriting. Back then, I also started getting more curious about
            other cultures, influenced by a travel expert, my mentor at the
            time.

            Later, while working for entertainment papers, I participated
            actively in pitching and creating two magazines, including a
            successful bimonthly with sparkly and quirky themes for young women.
            Late 2008, Japan LifeStyle was born. My responsibilities grew with
            the readership, and I went from copy editor to editor in chief.
            Those were six, sometimes challenging but always so unique, years.

            In 2016, after a year in South Korea, I decided to embrace the
            freelance road and to center on subjects I always enjoyed: travel,
            lifestyle, entertainment and IT.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I wrote and published three non-fiction books: one
            for a young audience and the other two focused on travel and
            lifestyle.
